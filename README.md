# Freescript
 Introducing Freescript! Freescript is a tool to convert audio to text effortlessly. Record voice or upload audio files, then copy or download the transcribed text. It also supports the feature of translating the text into multiple languages. It can be helpful in converting youtube videos into plain scripts.

 It uses Xenova's transcription model that is a neural network-based system designed to convert speech into text. It employs deep learning techniques, likely leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, to process audio input and generate corresponding textual output.

 This is one of the cool projects that I've built. This showcases my ReactJS and Tailwind's proficiency as well.
